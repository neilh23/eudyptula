Eudyptula
===

If you are reading this, it's got out ...

Eudyptula is realtime software synth specifically for making live drone/noise music,
available for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. At time of writing, only the
GNU/Linux version has been tested.

It consists of an array of oscillators, filters and control nodes, configurable
using script files, which are controlled by keyboard/mouse/Midi/OSC events.

The general design principles are that the GUI is for feedback only, and that nothing
is quantised (rounded to the nearest note/constricted in timing).
